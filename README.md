# ChatBot using GPT-3

This is a simple ChatBot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate natural language responses. The ChatBot is implemented in Python and uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The purpose of this README is to provide an overview of the ChatBot, its features, and how to use it.

## Introduction

The ChatBot is designed to facilitate conversations with users by generating text responses based on user input. It leverages the GPT-3 model provided by OpenAI for natural language generation. Here are some key features of this ChatBot:

- Simple and user-friendly graphical interface.
- Real-time conversation with the ChatBot.
- The ChatBot's responses are generated by GPT-3.
- Time-stamped messages for both the user and ChatBot.

## Prerequisites

Before using this ChatBot, you need to ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **OpenAI API Key**: You need to have a valid OpenAI API key. You can obtain it from the OpenAI platform.

2. **Python**: You must have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/obeidarash/nlp-simplebot.git
cd nlp-simplebot
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip.

```bash
pip install openai 
```
```bash
pip install tkinter
```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.

```bash
export OPENAI_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

## Customization

You can customize the ChatBot's behaviour by modifying the code. Here are some things you can customize:

- **GPT-3 Model**: You can change the GPT-3 model and its parameters in the `get_bot_response` function. Make sure to adjust the `model`, `max_tokens`, `n`, and `temperature` values according to your requirements.

- **UI Styling**: You can customize the UI of the ChatBot by modifying the appearance of the user and bot frames, labels, buttons, and the chat window.

- **Additional Features**: You can extend the ChatBot's functionality by adding more buttons, options, or commands.
